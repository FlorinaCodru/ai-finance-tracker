## Quick Start

## How to Use
Launch the app and input transactions via the right sidebar by choosing a date, amount, type, category, and an optional note.  Establish monthly budgets for each category and monitor progress with the Budget vs Actual bars, while KPIs and the trend line refresh immediately as you make edits.  Use date, type, and category filters to refine the view, then consult the Quick Insights card for highlights on savings rate and top spending enabling Gemini through an environment variable or sidebar field will result in more natural phrasing without exposing raw data.  Once you are prepared to analyze in another location, export the filtered dataset along with the KPI summary to CSV format.
